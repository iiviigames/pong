# Pong - CS50 2020 (Lesson 0) :orange_book:

Just enrolled in the Harvard's Intro to Game Development course for 2020.

Lesson 0 is a perfect start, with Pong. As the original repo states:

> Atari's 1972 classic, implemented in Lua with LÃ–VE

Having used Love for many years, and my language of choice for game development being Lua, this should be very old hat for me. Nevertheless, I'd like to take the course as it's taught without skipping anything, as if I were there myself.
